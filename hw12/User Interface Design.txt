User Interface Design

Things that make Windows 7 easty to use:
1. Desktop Icons - desktop icons and shortcuts and great because it makes navigating to folders very easy and make 
   starting applications very easy.
2. Search Bars - search bars are great because they make finding files and applications very easy.
3. Taskbar - the taskbar in Windows 7 is great because it groups all the windows of the same application together
   so that the taskbar doesn't get cluttered. When you hover over one of the icons with multiple windows open, a 
   thumbnail of the window appears so that you know which one you want to select and bring to the forefront of the
   screen. You can also pin your most used applications to the taskbar so that you can fire up an application right
   from the taskbar.
   
Things that make Windows 7 hard to use:
1. Crashing - when you do things too fast or click on something too many times or overload the CPU, programs will
   crash and will say "Not Responding" until you finally have to close it. I wish it would at least automatically
   restart instead of going through that whole charade of pretending that it is just "not responding" and that it
   hasn't crashed.
2. Start Menu Defaults - in the start menu, there are some "folders" that show up such as "Documents", "Pictures", 
   and "Music." These are not actually folders. They are libraries. It is misleading because there are folders
   called "My Documents," "My Pictures," and "My Music." The libraries by default do not contain the contents of
   these folders, which can be extremely annoying an confusing.
3. Desktop Icons - a lot of applications save to the desktop by default and it can become extremely cluttered and
   desired esktop shortcuts and icons will be hard to find.
